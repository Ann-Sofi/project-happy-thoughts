# Happy Thoughts
This project was to build a twitter-like app and using useState, useEffect and also both GET and POST from an API.
We were also to copy a finished design as close as possible.


# My project
I divided my app in three components: Header, MessageForm & MessageList. At first I put the hooks and fetch'es in the components, but realised that wouldn't be a good idea because one of my components needed information from another which was not possible (to my knowledge) with that kind of structure. So I moved most of the logic to app.js and by doing so I got to practise a bit more on props :-)

I used flexbox for the layout and moment to change the way the time on the message is viewed in the app.
